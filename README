Simulation of hackmanhattan.com "life"

"life" is a finite-state automaton in a cylindrical topology. It introduces random fluctionations,
and also responds to user input. The simulation does not introduce random fluctuations, but rather
explores what happens without them The intent is to see whether a game could be based on this that
allows users to be able to divine the effect of their actions, toward some goal; such as: winding up
in a state where all the nodes are a specified color.
